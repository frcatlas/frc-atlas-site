# FRC Atlas
### Dependencies
- Install pip dependencies with `pip install -r source/requirements.txt`
- To update dependencies, we use poetry. After any poetry changes, run `poetry export -f requirements.txt --output source/requirements.txt --without-hashes` to update the requirements.txt file.

### Local Development
- Run `sphinx-autobuild source build` to start a local server that will automatically rebuild the site when changes are made.
